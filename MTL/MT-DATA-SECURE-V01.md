# MT-DATA-SECURE-V01

## 2. Version
V01

## 3. Category
Data Security and Integrity

## 4. Purpose
This token marks the action that ensures data security at the BIT stage. It applies cryptographic methods (e.g., Blockchain) to confirm data authenticity and completeness.

## 5. Scope
- Applies during the BIT (Data Management) stage.
- Used when the system collects raw data from various sources (sensors, logs, databases).

## 6. Input
- Raw data sets before any cleaning or standardization.
- Data could include sensor readings, measurements, or metadata from internal or external sources.

## 7. Output
- Authenticated data sets with verified integrity.
- Data is now tagged and ready for the BOT (Data Cleaning and Integration) stage.

## 8. Associated Standards / Compliance
- S1000D: Ensures that references and documentation of this security step are consistent with technical publications.
- ATA Chapters: If data relates to aerospace operations, the token links secure data to the correct ATA chapters.
- MTL Framework: This token follows the MT-<DOMAIN>-<METHODID>-<VERSION> pattern, making it easy to integrate with other tokens.

## 9. Traceability and Audit
- By applying MT-DATA-SECURE-V01, auditors can trace all data sets that passed this security check.
- It shows which cryptographic methods the system used and the date/time of the verification.
- In case of discrepancies, users can review the logs associated with this token and confirm the dataâ€™s integrity.

## 10. References
- Internal security policy documents.
- User manuals for the BIT stage procedures.
- Any cryptographic key management or Blockchain configuration files.

## 11. Revision Notes
- V01: First release of the data security token. Future versions may add new encryption methods, new key management policies, or improved logging mechanisms.
