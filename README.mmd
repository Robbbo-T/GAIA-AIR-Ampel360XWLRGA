Below is the updated **Integral Document for the GAIA AIR Program**. In this version, the Data Module Codes (DMCs) have been assigned in compliance with S1000D standards, while maintaining compatibility with legacy ATA references as previously validated. The final DMC format incorporates:

- **MIC (Model Identification Code):** GAA  
- **ATA-based SNS codes:** Derived from ATA chapter references for each system/subsystem  
- **S1000D Information Codes:** Mapping old suffixes (DES, MNT, etc.) to S1000D Info Codes (SD, MP, FI, IP, OP, WD, MT, CT, etc.)  
- **ICN:** Preserving original numeric identifiers (with adjustments when necessary)  
- **Language Code:** E (English)

This approach allows maintainers to navigate using familiar ATA chapters while leveraging the modularity, reusability, and digital integration benefits of S1000D.

---

This final document is structured as follows:

1. GAIA AIR AMPEL Model program documentation (S1000D-oriented and IoT/AI integrated)  
2. Methods Token Library (MTL) integration and standard specification, fully compliant with S1000D and ATA references  
3. Demonstrations of how ATA-based SNS codes, ICNs, and Info Codes have been applied to Data Module Codes (DMCs)  
4. Recommendations, governance frameworks, security considerations, multilingual support, and advanced techniques (QCM, ALM, BIT) fully incorporated.

---

## 16. ATA to S1000D Mapping and SNS/ICN/Info Codes Usage

### Assigning SNS Codes Based on ATA Chapters
For minimal disruption, define SNS codes rooted in ATA chapters. Example:  
- ATA 72 (Engine) → SNS 7200  
- ATA 51 (Structures) → SNS 5100  
- ATA 34 (Navigation) → SNS 3400

### Information Codes
Map original suffixes (DES, MNT, FIM, IPD, PRC) to S1000D Info Codes (e.g., DES→SD, MNT→MP, FIM→FI, IPD→IP, PRC→OP).

### Preserving ICNs and Minimizing Disruption
Retain original numeric suffixes to maintain traceability. Only slight offsets if needed.

### Sample Data Module Code Transformations
- Original: GAA-ENG-DES-0001 → Engine Description  
  ATA 72 (Propulsion): SNS 7200, DES→SD  
  DMC: `GAA-7200-SD-00-E-0001`

- Original: GAA-NAV-MNT-0002 → Navigation Maintenance  
  ATA 34 (Navigation): SNS 3400, MNT→MP  
  DMC: `GAA-3400-MP-00-E-0002`

This ensures instant recognition: 7200 (ATA72) = engine domain, so old-school maintainers find familiarity in the numbering scheme.
